There are also better meanings to give to kanji as radicals: assigning\u300c\u7cf8\u300dthe meaning of "Spiderman" on the left and "Venom" on the bottom, rather than the dull "Thread" wherever, makes all its derivatives fairly easy. There are also a few ingenious stories made by some users, such as user fiminor coming up with one story to encapsulate\u300c\u9678\u300d,\u300c\u7766\u300d,\u300c\u52e2\u300d,\u300c\u71b1\u300d,\u300c\u83f1\u300d, and\u300c\u9675\u300d. In general, I would check the user-submitted stories for each kanji before I moved on, even if I made a good story myself, to make sure I would be aware of these things.']}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:['In order to come up with these good stories in the first place, there are a few things I found helpful to keep in mind. The biggest, by far, is to try to combine multiple kanji into one story. Heisig\'s book orders the kanji in a way that naturally lends itself to this, and there are around 100-200 kanji that I learned "for free", as I didn\'t have to come up with a separate story for them. For example, I did this for\u300c\u76e3\u300d,\u300c\u89a7\u300d,\u300c\u6feb\u300d, and\u300c\u9451\u300d, and I continue to do this today when I encounter new kanji (which I will discuss in detail soon) such as appending\u300c\u7dbe\u300dto fiminor\'s saga. I also found it important to give very specific images. For example, I struggled to distinguish\u300c\u5e1d\u300dand\u300c\u738b\u300dbecause both of their keywords ("Sovereign" and "King", respectively) are pretty similar and I pictured generic male royalty for both. I solved this by emphasizing  a sceptre held in the latter (as I took it to be a pictograph of one), and picturing Julius Caesar in the former. When the primitive "Altar" came up, it appears to the left as in\u300c\u8996\u300dor underneath as in\u300c\u6b3e\u300d, and I always pictured the former as more of a statue and the latter as an offering table, in order to identify their physical position in the kanji. I also tried to include real-life components, such as friends or recounting events, to have a stronger and more grounded story. For example, for\u300c\u68a2\u300dthe keyword "Treetop" and components "Tree... extinguish" reminded me of the time I went to the Arashiyama grove with my friend, who insisted there would be lights on, only to get off the train at night and walk to a completely pitch-black set of treetops. Be aware though that sometimes you ',Object(a.jsx)("i",{children:"don't"}),' need intricate stories for kanji. Something like\u300c\u5206\u300dwith the keyword "Part" can be taken instantly as a pictograph of a dagger splitting a board (or something). In general, I felt that it was only around kanji 1000 or so that I got a feel for kanji and could feel that certain combinations or positions were unnatural, and began to play fast-and-loose with my stories; before that I kept everything very deliberate.']}),Object(a.jsx)("p",{children:'That is essentially all the advice I can give. Going through RTK is a fairly personal journey, and like I mentioned before, you will struggle at seemingly random points that others will not, and likely find kanji someone else finds exceedingly hard to be quite straightforward. Overall, I found the hardest part of the book to be the section of around 20 kanji beginning at number 595, where Heisig introduces the "Turkey" primitive (funnily enough, I use the memory of my struggle here to remember the later-learned\u300c\u96e3\u300d, given the keyword "Difficult"). The hardest kanji to come up with stories for were\u300c\u85cd\u300dand\u300c\u74bd\u300d, although I don\'t think either of these took longer than 15 minutes. Mentally, the hardest parts were around kanji 700 and 1400, where I really wanted to quit for no particular reason other than being sick of the book and doing flashcards.'}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:["The kanji\u300c\u74bd\u300dbrings up an important critique of Heisig's RTK too. An analysis of around 800 million kanji uses, ",Object(a.jsx)("a",{href:"http://scriptin.github.io/kanji-frequency/",children:"available here"}),", lists it as the 2938th most used character in the best case, Wikipedia, and in one week of Twitter analysis it never came up at all. For some context, 1500 kanji generally gives you 97-99% coverage, depending on the material. So why is it in Heisig's book? Because the j\u014dy\u014d list has nothing to do with frequency. Sure, some (actually, a supermajority of) parts conveniently overlap, but the list is just a set of characters approved for general-use (as is the literal name). Due to the nature of kanji and literacy that I discussed at the beginning, it should be clear that the government needs some official list to which they can adhere, and so they need to ensure political topics are covered, which is why that kanji (keyword \"Imperial Seal\") made the cut. Do you need to know it? I doubt it. Thankfully, it's near the end of the book, so you can skip it without a loss. However, there are many kanji like this that appear throughout Heisig's book, and in general, the order in which they are presented in RTK has nothing to do with how important they are. This poses to me a problem much more significant than learning a few scores of uncommon kanji - an absurdly large amount of the most common kanji appear near the end of the book. And unfortunately, you can't skip to them and do them first (generally speaking), because they are built upon kanji learned earlier, so the method won't work. Plus, the first 500 or so kanji in the book have exposition written by Heisig through which he slowly teaches you how to come up with stories on your own; immediately skipping to\u300c\u5e30\u300dand reading \"Spear... broom... apron\" will seem impossible to handle. This means Heisig's book loses a lot of its usefulness unless you're willing to push to at least the 1600 or 1800 mark."]}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:["This also means a few fairly simple kanji that ",Object(a.jsx)("i",{children:"aren't"})," j\u014dy\u014d, such as the\u300c\u5b09\u300dof\u300c",Object(a.jsxs)("ruby",{children:["\u5b09",Object(a.jsx)("rt",{children:"\u3046\u308c"})]}),"\u3057\u3044\u300d(",Object(a.jsx)("strong",{children:"Pleased"}),") or both kanji in\u300c",Object(a.jsxs)("ruby",{children:["\u55a7",Object(a.jsx)("rt",{children:"\u3051\u3093"}),"\u5629",Object(a.jsx)("rt",{children:"\u304b"})]}),"\u300d(",Object(a.jsx)("strong",{children:"Argument"}),"), hence are not in RTK. However, this doesn't really matter, because there aren't too many of them, and once you've gotten that far learning new kanji is very easy.

The whole process (plus coming up with a keyword on my own!) - identifying components and making a story - rarely takes more than 45 seconds.

I found it incredibly helpful. I was free for a summer, grinded out the book in a very short amount of time, and began learning Japanese with a large effective-vocabulary, an easy time memorizing new words, never stressing when I encountered new kanji - which happened fairly rarely anyways - and never having to worry about not knowing enough kanji to read a piece of literature. At the same time, I tried it beforehand and (thankfully only temporarily) gave up on learning the language and wasted a few months of my time, but potentially could've turned a blind-eye to Japanese for the rest of my life.
